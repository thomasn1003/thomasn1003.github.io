### CPSC 120

#### Fall 2022

* Lab 3
Lab 3 part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was the first c++ code that gave me a starting challenge. It was something I've never coded before and I learned how to make inputs with C++. This lab was the first time I coded a Mad Lib and it is something you can show your friends and family. 

* Lab 7
Lab 7 part 2 was my favorite and most memorable project I have done in this course. I never learned how to play blackjack and coding it is even harder to learn. In this project I learned not only how to play blackjack but also how to code a blackjack calculator. 

* Lab 10
Lab 10 part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was something that I could actually use in the future. The project taught me how to code a rectangle area calculator. Although it was not the most challenging project it still taught me that I can create useful tools to help in math.
